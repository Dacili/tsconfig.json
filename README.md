# tsconfig.json
Usually, when working with **FE frameworks**, you use the **CLI** provided by the framework to generate the initial state of the app. There are some files, that we, in most cases *ignore, until we need them*.  
One example of that is the **Angular** framework, which uses **angular-cli** for creating app.  
My focus, for now, is the file **tsconfig.json.**

## What is tsconfig.json file?
The presence of a tsconfig.json file in a directory indicates that the directory is the *root of a TypeScript project*.  
The file specifies the root files and the *compiler options required to compile the project*.
